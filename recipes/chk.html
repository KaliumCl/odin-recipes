        <p>You ever have a recipe that you randomly crave at the early hours of the morning?
            Do you get chills thinking how long its been since the last time you ate this?
            Are you needing to wipe drool off your keyboard this very moment just thinking about it?
        </p>
        <p>Well strap yourselves in, because this chicken will take you for a <strong><em>RIDE!</em></strong></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>3-4 cups mayonnaise</li>
            <li>garlic (the more the merrier)</li>
            <li>shredded parmesan cheese (see garlic)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water (tap is fine, unless you live in Flint)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add chicken, water and garlic (measure with your heart) to the instant pot</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid, ensuring the vent is sealed</li>
            <li>Select the "poultry" setting (if not available, high pressure for 15 minutes)</li>
            <li>Note: if chicken is frozen, add 10 minutes to time</li>
            <li>Once cooking is complete, release pressure</li>
            <li>With two forks, shred the chicken</li>
            <li>Add mayo to the pot and stir, one cup at a time, until a desireable creamy consistency is achieved</li>
            <li>Add parmesan to taste</li>
            <li>Serve hot (I like mine in a sandwich but you could even eat this straight up)</li>
        </ol>
